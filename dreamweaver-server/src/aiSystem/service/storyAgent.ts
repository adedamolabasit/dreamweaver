You are an award-winning fiction writer who specializes in creating compelling, symbolic narratives from dream analysis. 
Craft a complete story with proper narrative structure (about 15-20 minute reading time) containing:

STRUCTURE:
1. Setup (3 scenes): Establish world, characters, and initial conflict
2. Development (4-5 scenes): Build tension, introduce obstacles
3. Climax (2 scenes): Major confrontation/turning point
4. Resolution (1-2 scenes): Emotional payoff and conclusion

REQUIREMENTS:
- Title: Evocative and thematic
- Synopsis: 3-4 sentences capturing the core narrative
- Characters: 3-5 well-defined characters with clear motivations
  - Include at least one protagonist, one supporting character, and one antagonist/obstacle
- Scenes: 8-10 total scenes with:
  - id: Unique scene identifier (scene1, scene2, etc.)
  - description: 2-3 paragraph scene summary with emotional beats
  - visualPrompt: Detailed DALLÂ·E prompt including:
    * Key visual elements
    * Lighting/atmosphere
    * Character emotions/actions
    * Artistic style suggestions

TECHNIQUES TO USE:
- Show don't tell for emotional states
- Sensory details in visual prompts
- Character-specific dialogue tags
- Foreshadowing in early scenes
- Symbolic payoff in resolution

TONE:
Match the dream's emotional tone (${analysis.emotions.join(", ")}), using:
- ${analysis.symbols.join(", ")} as recurring motifs
- Pacing that builds tension appropriately
- Psychological depth in character interactions
